            In Wolfenbüttel, the exclusion, discrimination, and deportation of Jewish residents occurred openly, in full view of the public. The boycott of Jewish businesses on April 1, 1933, was the Nazis' first organized step, as the regime believed that their anti-Jewish measures would be welcomed by the non-Jewish majority. Beginning in September 1935, the so-called Nuremberg Laws stripped Jews of full citizenship and prohibited marriage and sexual relations between Jews and non-Jews.
By 1938, the Nazi regime had advanced its efforts to eliminate Jews from economic life. On the one hand, the goal was to impoverish Jews to accelerate their forced emigration. On the other hand, the Reich used the emigration process and the 1931 Reich Flight Tax to confiscate Jewish assets for the benefit of the German state. Furthermore, the "Aryanization" of formerly Jewish-owned businesses and enterprises transferred their ownership to "Aryan" Germans, leaving Jews with no significant role in the local economy by late summer 1938. In late July of that year, merchant Willi Sparmann announced in the Braunschweiger Tageszeitung that the Hermann Daniel department store had "passed into Aryan hands."
Kristallnacht (the Night of Broken Glass) on November 9–10, 1938, marked a further escalation of violence against Wolfenbüttel’s Jews. Nazis forced their way into Jewish homes and apartments, assaulted the residents, and destroyed their belongings. At least 33 local Jews were arrested by SS men, initially detained in the Wolfenbüttel prison, and then temporarily incarcerated in the Buchenwald concentration camp along with approximately 9,800 other Jewish men. In Buchenwald, they endured a loss of rights, humiliation, and constant fear of death. Released between December 8, 1938, and April 12, 1939, most sought to leave Germany as quickly as possible to save their lives and those of their families.
With the emigration ban enacted on October 23, 1941, flight was no longer an option. The approximately 40 Jews still living in Wolfenbüttel, many elderly and impoverished after being stripped of their assets, were almost all assigned to "Jewish houses" by the city administration between September and November 1941.
The first deportation took place on March 31, 1942. Thirty-one Jews from Wolfenbüttel were arrested and taken to Braunschweig, where they joined a deportation train carrying 1,000 Jews to Warsaw the following day. Upon arrival in the Warsaw Ghetto on April 2, 1942, most deportees, including those from Wolfenbüttel, were murdered in the Treblinka extermination camp after July 22, 1942. On July 11, 1942, the Gestapo deported 12 additional Jews from Braunschweig and Wolfenbüttel to Auschwitz, where they were killed.
On March 17, 1943, eleven Wolfenbüttel Jews were among 1,342 Jews deported on the "Fourth Large Transport of the Elderly" from Berlin to the Theresienstadt Ghetto. The German state and "Volksgenossen" from Wolfenbüttel seized the property of those deported.
